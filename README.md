# FAFCab Microservices Architecture

Description of the architecture of a microservices-based system for the FAFCab, designed to support internal operations through modular, scalable services. The system uses an event-driven model with RabbitMQ as the message broker and an API Gateway for external access.

## Core Architecture Components

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests.
- **RabbitMQ (RMQ)**: Message broker enabling asynchronous communication between services.
- **Notification Service**: Central hub for sending alerts via email, push, or Discord.
- **User Service**: Identity provider used across all services.

All services communicate either directly via REST APIs or asynchronously using events over RMQ.
